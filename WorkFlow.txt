- Prompt (provided by prof. 지한) => Compare LLaMa vs. Chat GPT
    1. What are the best MOFs for carbon capture?
    2. what is the highest record MOF for methane storage applications for ANG?
    3. what type of mofs can selectively bind nitrogen over methane for nitrogen methane separation applications? 
    4. how many mofs have density less than 0.01g/cm^3? 
    5. can you provide me with a synthesis conditon for a crystalline ZIF-8 and a synthesis condition for an amorphous ZIF-8?  
    6. What kind of materials consist of Zn, O, C, and H atoms?
    7. what is the best mof for water harvesting? 
    8. what do these structures have in common?  LTA, MOF-5, MFI, HKUST-1 
    9. which MOFs have surface area larger than 7000 m^2/g? 
    10. what determines stacking modes in 2D MOFs and COFs?  
- Is LLaMa Fine-tuning is available?

- LLaMa vs. Chat GPT (Domain-specific!!!) => Model should be pre-trained with MOF Domain (See below references) But how???
